## Introduction On The Project Side

The focus of this project is to design, implement a generally well-constructed restaurant dishes management system. In this system, this user could mainly do four things:
   * Filtering the dishes by desired order. Such as by their name, price, category, and level of spicy.
   * Add new dishes to the system. The user could customize the one dishes’ information at a time, then upload the newly created dishes to the system.
   * Delete dishes. The user could delete the chosen dishes from the system.
 
## Introduction On The Programming Side
In this project, we followed the general structure and knowledge that’s been taught and absorbed during this term’s course to implement our project. This includes the style and format of writing HTML files, CSS files, client-side JS code, server-side JS code, handlebars, NodeJS, NPM, etc.
However, we did use something “new” for this project. Instead of using JSON files to store and load the data, we choose to use MongoDB to keep track of our data.
